# About:
This web development project is one which I've been working on for some time with the goal to learn about front end frameworks such as React.js and gain more experience in backend technologies which rely on Python. It's a fun typing test where a user is given a snippet and they can see how fast they can complete it. Results are saved to a uers profile, which they can view by navigating to that section. I still have a lot of work I'd like to do, but rome wasn't built in a day. I'm no designer, but the funcitonality is there. 

See below for more information on my build.


### Current Issues
'''
- Newly created user accounts can sign in and out once created, however on server refresh they can not. It's as accounts created during last server refresh are wipped
- User's completed snippet hisotry are not loading rendering in profile page
- Need to avoid using eval() due to Google's Content Security Policy. Havn't investigated the occurences of it/what it afftects
