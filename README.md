# About:
This web development project is one which I've been working on for some time with the goal to learn about front end frameworks such as React.js and gain more experience in backend technologies which rely on Python. It's a fun typing test where a user is given a snippet and they can see how fast they can complete it. Results are saved to a uers profile, which they can view by navigating to that section. I still have a lot of work I'd like to do, but rome wasn't built in a day. I'm no designer, but the funcitonality is there. 

See below for more information on my build.


### Current Roadblocks
- Need to avoid using eval() due to Google's Content Security Policy. Havn't investigated the occurences of it/what it afftects
- Still working on the full MySQL to PostgreSQL migration, so there are not as many snippets as there were before, nor the format I prefer.
- There's some minor formatting issues that I need fixed, but that's minor

### Front-end 
- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Vercel (for hosting)

### Back-end:
- Python
- FastAPI 
- PostgreSQL (originally in MySQL)
- Uvicorn (server that runs and serves the FastAPI app
- Render (for hosting)
